      <img src="assets/images/IMG_7855.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Isai Solis">

      <p>I am an aspiring developer that has lived in Austin for the past seven years.  During the first part of that timeframe, I completed a degree in Economics from the University of Texas.  I am currently learning the basics of web development through the coding bootcamp also at the University of Texas.
        </p>
        
        <p>Some of the things I enjoy are visiting restaurants around the city that offer cuisine from around the world.  I also frequent the Alamo Drafthouse because they will kick someone out of the theater if they are disruptive.  I try and stay active, but it is not uncommon to find me on the couch watching old episodes of Rick and Morty.
